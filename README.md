# AnotherProxiServices
An Android project for testing various features, such as Drawer, fragments and so on.

The purpose of the application is to connect people to exchange services each other, much like a LETS.
Services are called "missions".
Completed missions shall be recorded and after 20 missions done,
people will be proposed to enroll the same system without any recording of their missions, 
because the ultimate goal is to help each other _for free_.
Once you have a solid relationship in your community, no money or accounting whatsoever should interfer.
