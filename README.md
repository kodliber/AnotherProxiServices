# AnotherProxiServices
An Android project for testing various features, such as Drawer, fragments.

The idea of the application is to connect people to exchange services each other, much like a LETS.
Services are called "missions".
Missions completed shall be recorded and after 20 missions in their neighborhood, 
people will be proposed to enroll the same system without any recording of their missions, 
because the ultimate goal is to help each other _for free_.
Once you have a solid relationship in your community, no money or accounting whatsoever should interfer.
